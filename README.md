## Introduction 
Puzzlrs allows people who love puzzles to trade amongst each other. As puzzlers ourselves, we identified a shared experience: who wants to do a puzzle more than once? We all related to having multiple 'gently used' puzzles gathering dust in our homes while we were out buying new every time. We set out to provide an alternative, more sustainable solution. We envisioned a circuit of puzzles being sent around amongst a community of puzzle lovers. It's a win-win: everyone gets to enjoy doing new puzzles and there is less waste. And we all have emptier cabinets.

With puzzlrs, users can log in and upload their own puzzles available for trade. They can view the full list and filter by metrics like category, piece count, and quality. By clicking any given puzzle, they can request a trade. Whoever's puzzle is being requested then receives an email. Via their user profile, they can see all puzzles they've listed, any requests they've sent, and they can accept or deny and requests they've received.

## Wins And Challenges 

### Wins
- A requirement for this project was that we self-teach and use a technology we had not used before. We decided to implement TypeScript. One key win was our ability to learn TypeScript in a very short period and use it in a complex web app.
- We also used React' Context API and this made for a fairly streamlined data model.
- It was a great experience using React's MUI library for beautiful, standardized components.

### Challenges 
- As stated above, we challenged ourselves to implement TypeScript. This came with a healthy dose of challenges. Certain processes and features took longer than originally planned. Because we were learning as we went, we feel we would have planned differently from the beginning in terms of data flow and structure had we been more familiar with the intricacies of typed JavaScript.

  
## Future Improvements
- Implement actual log in functionality. So that user can sign in or create a new account.
- Refine functionality so that a user cannot request their own puzzle.
- Add more user-user communication features:
  - Build out request mechanic so that requestor can include a puzzle they are suggesting as a trade
  - Add messaging between users once request is accepted
